# exploring-the-bitcoin-market
This is a project on [DataCamp](http://www.datacamp.com/)

To better understand the growth and impact of Bitcoin and other [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) you will, in this project, explore the market capitalization of different cryptocurrencies.

Warning: The cryptocurrency market is exceptionally volatile, and any money you put in might disappear into thin air. Never invest money you can't afford to lose.

To complete this project, you need to be fluent with pandas DataFrames.

Open the **notebook.ipynb** to see details.

To repeat this work on your own computer, please download the cvs files and put them in a folder called **datasets** and put this folder together with **notebook.ipynb** in another folder.
